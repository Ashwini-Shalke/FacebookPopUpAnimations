  ### Long-Press Gesture
Long-Press gesture is a subclass of Gesture, which is nothing but press and hold gesture. Long press Gesture will be continuous gesture where your action methods will be called multiples times based on the state changes. You can add this gesture on any objects deriving from UIView. 

You can configure the number of gesture, number of taps and minimum press duration also.
